           a simple wrapper for commands which access sensitive files

= about

Occasionally you need to run commands which put sensitive information in files.
Then, through poor life choices, you want to commit those files to a source
repository or something similar. This program will let you transparently
decrypt a file, run your command, and then re-encrypt the file again.

The usage will make how this usefull more obvious.

= usage

First, you need to bootstrap the encryption by encrypting your sensitive files.

    $ cryptdo-boostrap -passphrase hunter2 terraform.tfstate
    $ rm terraform.tfstate

Next, you can run commands which need to access those files by decorating them
with cryptdo. This will decrypt the file, run the command, and then re-encrypt
the file with any changes.

    $ cryptdo -passphrase hunter2 -- terraform apply

If you need to change the key of your encrypted files then the following
command is your friend.

    $ cryptdo-rekey -old hunter2 -new abetterkey terraform.tfstate.enc
